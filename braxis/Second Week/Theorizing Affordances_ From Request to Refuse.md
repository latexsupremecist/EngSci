## Theorizing Affordances: From Request to Refuse

### Definitions

#### Request
- Asks of user
	- e.g. speed bumps request users to slow down

#### Demand
- Request that cannot be refused
	- e.g. Facebook demands users to pick male/female as a gender
- Users can technically rebuff demands
	- e.g. running ubuntu on a mac

#### Encourage
- Encourages one alternative, discourages others
	- e.g. large plates encourages eating more

#### Discourage
- Effort is required
	- e.g. Tinder discourages laboured consideration

#### Refuse
- Action unavailable
	- e.g. treating certain monitors as touchscreens

#### Allow
- Available, neither encouraged or discouraged
	- low hanging bridges allow small vehicles to pass

### Examples
- Filling in a form
	- Some answers are required
	- Some answers are encouraged (no red star)

- Staying off
	- rope fences encourage it
	- electric fences demand it

### Conclusion
All of these may change with time (Video conferencing goes from allowed to requested and finally demanded)

#### Perception
Functions do not make sense if users do not know of their existance/do not know how they operate. Everything is refused by default if users know not of them.

#### Cultural/Institutional Legitimacy
- Women driving is at least allowed, if not encouraged, but cultural factors may discourage it
