My notes (starting from) 2<sup>nd</sup> Year Engineering Science at the University of Toronto. Includes funny electives.

#### Note

*Edit: This is just for 拋磚引玉, because I don't understand enough of lectures now in 3<sup>rd</sup> year to make good notes.*

Things I find obvious are not included in the notes. Things I don't find obvious are. What I think is obvious may not coincide with what you thing is obvious, and vice versa. Feel free to submit pull requests (I make a lot of typos).
