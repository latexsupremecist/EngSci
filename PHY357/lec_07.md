HW2 is out

## Quark
- 3 generations, just like leptons
- Non-integer charges
- took us a long time to accept that they are real physical things

### Particle Zoo era
- hadrons were discovered before quarks
    - they are particles bound together by strong forces
    - most are unstable, except for the proton
    - baryons and mesons
- without good explanation for these, it is likely we are missing some fundamental theory behind them
- they are probably composed of more fundamental particles -> quarks

### Evidence of Quarks
- the theory makes sense
- Electron scattering experiments on protons reveal sub structure (a few to 10 GeV); proton mass ~ 1 GeV
- think Rutherford scattering
- e+ e- -> q + q bar
- Jets are formed in the fragmentation of final state quarks

### Quark Confinement
- Free quarks are easily distinguished because they do not have integer charge
- Lightest quark would be stable -> cannot further decay ito smaller particles
- Interact strongly, since there are large numbers of hadrons in low energy proton collisions
- We have not seen free quarks
    - strong force is strong enough that to separate two quarks, the energy is enough to generate additional quarks from vacuum -> hadrons

### Properties
- Proton: uud, charge of 1
- Neutron: udd, charge of 0
- range of masses across generations
    - harder to make quarks with higher masses, so they were discovered later

### Conservation of Flavour
- Strong/EM interactions, quarks (dis)appear in quark-antiquark pairs
    - e+ + e- -> b + b bar possible
    - e+ + e- -> s + b bar impossible

### Decays
- other quarks are **spectators**
- via weak interaction; flavour is not conserved, but total number is conserved
    - c -> s + u + d bar
- can include leptons
    - c -> s + mu- + nu_mu bar
- before quarks, we knew baryon number was conserved, with
$$B = \frac{N_q}{3}$$

### Hadrons as combinations of quarks
- strong forces that hold quarks together is so strong we cannot "remove individual quarks" to study their properties
    - reverse engineering (best engineering)

### Flavour Independence of Strong Force
- ud binding is identicay to us binding, uc binding
- precursor to flavour indepnedence of *nucleon* binding energy
- EM corrections amount to small penalty for bringing two similarly charged quarks together
- hence protons and neutrons have similar masses

### Quark rules
- Baryons: qqq has baryon number 1
- Mesons: q qbar has baryon number 0
- Anti-Baryons: -1
- Implications
    - Baryon and anti-baryons can annihilate into mesons
    - lightest baryon is stable (proton)
    - lightest mesons can decay only through EM or weak processes

### Top Quark
- much heavier than others
- no hadrons
- lifetime is so short that it decays before forming hadrons
