## Beta decay
- 2 body decay process
    - extra electron and anti-neutrino
- very common
    - extra electron only costs 0.5 MeV
    - Both electron and nucleon have spin 1/2, so spin/angular momentum is conserved, avoiding penalties
- types
    - extra neutrons: emits electron, gains proton
    - extra protons: emits positron, proton becomes neutron
    - electron capture: captures electron, proton becomes neutron
        - typically a very tight bound atomic electron (K-shell)
- no change in A, Z changes by 1

### Energy spectrum
- Expected a 2 body final state, which implies beta energy is constant (total energy known, then conservation of momentum)
- energy is actually on a continuous spectrum
- actually neutrinos are also emitted
    - difficult to detect
    - almost massless
    - neutral charge

## Weak Interaction
- weak forces responsible for long lifetime for bta decay reactions

## Phenomenonology
- spontaneous reactions have to lose mass
- see semi-empirical mass formula, parabola when
    - odd A, pairing correction vanishes
    - even A, odd-odd or even-even

### Odd Nuclei
- e.g. for A = 111, Cd (Z = 84) is the most stable

### Even Nuclei
- Hard and complicated

## Fission
- Potential barrier: need to get activation energy
    - could be QM tunneling, but unlikely

## Gamma decay
- In addition to x rays
- If daughter nucleus after alpha/beta decay is excited
- E&M so fast
