## Recap: QCD
- QCD describes colour charges and gluons
- Vacuum polarisation leads to running couplings
	- at low energies, EM is weaker, since virtual pair production is harder
	- at low energies, strong force is stronger, since there are less gluons which shield the strong force (destructive interference)
- Gluons can be radiated and generate jets

## Quark Gluon Plasma
- normally confined in hadrons
- can exist over extended volumes at high energy densities
	- need multi-particle interactions over large volumes
	- only possible in heavy-ion collisions

## Proton Structure Function
- protons are not fundamental
	- proton collisions are difficult to understand
	- depends on initial state of gluon
	- momentum distribution
	- probability of containing virtual s, b, c and antiquarks

## Standard Model of Weak Interactions
$$M(q^2) = \frac{g^2}{q^2 - M_X^2}$$
- Holds for both EM and weak forces
- For EM, $g = e$ and $M_X = 0$: massless photon
- For weak interactions, $g \approx e$ and $M_X = M_{\frac{W}{Z}} \approx 80-90$GeV
- At low energies, weakness is simply due to heavy mass of W/Z bosons

### Predictions of Electroweak Unification
- consequences include existence of massive bosons
- neutral current weak interactions
