## More about subatomic particles

### Fermions
- half-integer spin
- Obeys Pauli exclusion principle: no 2 fermions occupy the smae quantum state
- associated usually with matter

### Bosons
- integer spin
- Does not obey exclusion principle
- Generally inprepreted as force carrier particles

### Antiparticles
- predicted by relativity and QM
- every particle has corresponding antiparticles
    - electron-positron
    - quark-antiquark
    - proton-antiproton
- some particles are their own antiparticles
    - photons
    - an open question is whether or not antineutrinos are different, since neutrinos have no charge

## Symmetry is equal to conservation
- any operator that commutes with the hamiltonian is constant with respect to time, so its eigenvalue is conserved
    - spatial translations conserve momentum
    - spatial rotations conserve angular momentum
    - time translations conserve energy

### Parity Operator
- gives the mirror image
- its square is the identity operator
- should lead to conservation law
    - EM and strong interactions conserve parity
    - weak interactions don't

### Charge conjugation
- change the charge of all particles in a system (particle -> antiparticle)
- change the signs of E, B

### Time Reversal
- signs of linear, orbital angular momentum changed
- CPT conserved in all interactions as far as we know
- lifetimes and masses of particles and antiparticles identical

## Particle interactions
- reaction equations (similar to chemistry)
- one can always remove a particle from initial state and add the antiparticle to the final state
- \* = excited state

## Feynman Diagrams
- use as mnemonics to follow conserved quantities through reactions
- governed by Feynman rules

## Feynman Amplitude
- Yukawa potential
$$V(r) = -\frac{g^2}{4\pi}\frac{e^{-r/R}}{r}$$
- leads to quantum mechanical transition amplitude (see textbook)
$$f(q^2) = \frac{-g^2\hbar^2}{q^2+M_\chi^2c^2}$$
