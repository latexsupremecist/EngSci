## Virtual particle
- An electron can emit photons at any point and reabsorb it
	- Heisenberg uncertainty principle; as long as time is short enough
- If there is another electron close enough, it can absorb this photon
	- one-photon exchange process
	- virtual photon
- The virtual photons can split into virtual electrons and positrons
- Leads to vacuum polarisation
	- EM coupling becomes larger when particles get closer
	- Same happens for quarks, but they get weaker instead

## Jets from Gluons
- $e^+ + e^- \rightarrow q\bar q$
- each quark then splits into jets of hadrons
- quarks can easily produce extra gluons (probability ~10%)

## QCD Colour Counting
- All reactions happen at equal rate, scaled by relative charge
- At high energies, all quarks should be possible
- Data is consistent with there being exactly 3 colours
