## Theme of Lecture
- Lower energy states are favoured
- The stronger the interaction, the faster it'll happen

## Nuclear Mass
- First approx: just the total mass of protons and neutrons
- In reality the mass is a bit lower, by the binding energy

### Binding Energy
- Grows rapidly with A (per nucleon) for A < 20
- 20 < A < 60: begins to  saturate
- A = 60: max (Fe)
- A > 60: decreases gradually

### Semi-Empirical Mass Formula
- simplified model
- assume nucleus is incompressible liquid droplet (Liquid Drop Model)
- $f_0(Z, A) = Z (m_p + m_e) + (A-Z)m_n$
- five additional corrections

#### Volume Correction
- $f_1(A) = -a_vA$
- Nuclear force is short range; energy proportional to volume

#### Surface Correction
- $f_2(A) = a_s A^{2/3}$
- Surface nucleons have fewer neighbours

#### Coulomb Correction
- $f_3(A) = a_c Z^2 A^{-1/3}$

#### Asymmetry Correction
- $f_4(Z, A) = a_a \frac{(Z - A/2)^2}{A}$
- Pauli Exclusion Principle

#### Pairing Correction
- $f_5(A) = \pm a_p A^{-1/2}$
- A pair of nucleons in the same state combine in a spin-0 doublet wave function
- both Z, N even: negative correction
- both odd: positive correction
- odd, even: no correction
