## ATLAS experiment
- Combine particle detector systems to design a full collider experiment
- ATLAS detector
    - first collect information with minimal disturbance (keep trajectory roughly the same)
    - once all information has been harvested, use calorimeters to find energy
    - muon detectors are usually placed outside, because they have a greater radius, and they do not lose much energy in the detector/largely undisturbed
- photons and electrons produce showers in the EM calorimeter
    - trajectory differentiates e+e-
- detect tauon before it decays
- cover as much of solid angle as possible
- trigger system identifies interesting events on the fly (FPGAs, CPUs take too much time)

### ATLAS magnets
- 2T solenoid in inner detector
- 3T toroids in muon tracker
    - transverse momentum
