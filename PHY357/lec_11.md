## Semiconductor Dectectors
- Charged particles don't ionise material
- Electron-hole pairs created in band gap
- only 3eV needed to create pairs
- pass voltage across semiconductor; if particle passes through, it will form electron-hole pairs, producing a current signal
- Advantages
    - good energy resolution
    - can be very thin
- Disadvantages
    - expensive
    - fragile

### Semiconductor Detector Applications
- precise dE/dx measurements
- lithography to measure position of charged particles
    - high resolution with small strips
- Charged Coupled Devices (CCD) can be made smaller

## Cherenkov Radiation
- when a muon travels faster than c/n in a medium
- superposition of EM fields along a particular direction
    - similar to shock wave when breaking the sound barrier
    - real photons radiated at said angle
- cherenkov light is shiny

### Cherenkov Threshold
- produced in any transparent medius
- no light if $\beta < \frac{1}{n}$

## Calorimeter
- measure total energy of particles by absorption
- incident particles initiate a shower in detector
- total energy proportional to energy of incident particle

### Sampling Calorimeter
- alternating layers of absorber and readout

### Calorimeter Systems
- cover all solid angle around collision point


## ATLAS Experiment
- electrons and positrons are fundamental particles
    - we know the initial state very well
- protons and anti-protons are composite particles
    - collisions are between quarks and gluons inside
    - this is harder to know/calculate
    - likely to have a small transverse momentum
