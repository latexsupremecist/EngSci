## Announcements
- Tutorials start this week
    - Thursday 12-1, MP134
- HW1 out

## Cross Sections
- Interaction probability of projectile on target (unit of area)
- Beam Flux: $J = n_bv_i$
- Target per length $N$
- Rate $W_r = JN\sigma_r$
- Luminosity defined as $L \equiv JN$
- Angular Scattering Cross Section (derivation in textbook)

## Decay Constant
$$N(t) = N_0e^{-t/\tau}$$
- $\tau$ is the mean lifetime, and $\lambda = \frac{1}{\tau}$ is the decay constant
- Can be predicted by quantum mechanics and phase space
- Natural decay width $\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}$
- Total decay width $\Gamma = \sum_f \Gamma_f$, with branching ratio $B_f = \Gamma_f/\Gamma$
- Energy follows Breit-Wigner distribution
$$N_f(W) \propto \frac{\Gamma_f}{(W-M)^2c^4+\Gamma^2/4}$$
- The faster a particle decays, the broader the range of final state energies of decay products

## Units
- Energy: eV
- Mass: eV/c^2
- Momentum: eV/c

### eV
- Energy gained by electron accelerated in a 1V field
- $c = m_e = \hbar = \varepsilon_0 = 1$

## Special Relativity
- Appendix B

### Lorentz Transformation of 4-vectors
- Frame moves along $x$ with velocity $v$
- $x' = \gamma(x-vt)$
- $t' = \gamma\left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right)$
- $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$
- $\vec p = \gamma m\vec v$
- norm and dot products of 4-vectors are invariant, where
$$A\cdot B = A^tgB, g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$

## Strong Force
- Nuclei exist, need strong force bounding protons together, overcoming Coulomb repulsion
    - short distance; not observed outside nucleus
    - no classical analogue

## Nuclei
- Isotope: same element
- Isotone: same neutrons
- Isobars: same number of nucleons (~mass)

## Differential Cross section and Form Factor
- Assume target is point like: derive differential cross-section
- Form Factors included in more realistic models (corrections)
- Form Factors shown to exist experimentally

## Nuclear Properties
- Size: more or less incompressible
- Masses: mass deficit due to binding energy
- Binding energy per nucleon: greatest for Fe, decreases along both directions (number of nucleons in nucleus)
