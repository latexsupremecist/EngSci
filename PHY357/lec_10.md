## Photons
- Detected by interactions that produced charged particles
    - Photoelectric effect (low energy)
    - Compton scattering (energy around 1 MeV)
    - e-e+ pair production (high energy; once photons have sufficient energy to do this, it will)
- either absorbed or scattered through large angle
    - doesn't make sense to have dE/dx
    - we find the probability the photon is still here instead
        - classically: percentage of photons in stream of photon that remains
        - quantum: simply the probability amplitude

### Photoelectric Effect
- atomic electron liberated upon absorbing photon
    - $$T_e = E_\gamma - B_e$$
    - kinetic energy is photon energy minus binding energy
    - if electron is free, 4-momentum conservation is violated
    - mostly K-shell electrons; nearby nucleus absorbs recoil momentum
    - electron hole filled by another electron (e.g. L shell), energy emitted as X-ray

### Compton Scattering
- photon scatters off quasi-free atomic electron
- direction of outgoing photon depends on incoming photon energy and electron mass
- for low energy photon (compared to electorn mass), cross section is symmetric across solid angles
- at high energies, $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$ peaks at $\Theta = 0$

### Electron Positron Pair Production
- There is always a reference frame where the pair has equal but opposite momentum
- momentum of photon not conserved
- cannot happen in vacuum; nucleus must balance momentum

### Electromagnetic Showers
- Bremsstrahlung dominates electron energy loss
- in pair production, if electrons/positrons have excess energy, they will release photons, that split into electron positron pairs, etc.
- statistical process

### Strong Interactions of Hadrons
- strong force dominates hadron/nucleii interactions at short distance
- rarer than EM, but dominate at high energy (> 1GeV) in dense materials

### Hadronic Showers
- higher lateral momentum, so wider showers than EM

## Particle Detectors
- Ionisation chambers
- Scintillation detectors (dectects photons directly)

### Ionisation Chambers
- external electric field to separate ions and electrons
- current is measured
- at higher charges, neutral particles can be ionised

#### Proportional regime
- secondary ionisation possible


#### Multiwire proportional chamber
- wires along $x$ and $y$ axis, stacked vertically
- charged particle passes through and interacts with a wire from each layer
- $\Delta x, \Delta y$ can be measured, giving direction

#### Geiger Counter
- voltage so high that any ionisation from radiation is detected

#### Scintillator
- charged particle can excite atom in transparent material
- light emitted when atom de-excited
- light detected via photoelectric effect
- fluorescence
