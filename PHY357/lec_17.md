## Weak Interactions
- Electroweak unification is analogous to E&M unification

### Symmetries
- maximally violate charge and parity
- almost conserve CP

#### Evidence of parity Non-Conservation
$$^{60}Co \rightarrow ^{60}Ni^* + e^- + \nu_e$$
- L is unaffected under parity transformations
- J is unchanged
- Conservation implies electrons have no preference between going in one direction or the opposite, since we get the same setup for a parity operation (see slides)
- but there is!

#### Consequences of CP Transforms
- C and P are not separately conserved
- CP is conserved
- Simultaneous CP transformation is a symmetry of weak decays that only involve leptons

### Helicity
- right-handed: positive
- left-handed: negative
- Conserved for massless particles
- Not precisely conserved for massive particles

### Spin Structure of Weak Interactions
- only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed anti-neutrinos are observed
- Consistent with C & P observations
	- C turns $\nu_L$ to $\bar \nu_L$
	- P turns $\nu_L$ to $\nu_R$
	- CP turns $\nu_L$ to $\bar \nu_R$

### Massive Particles
- Helicity is not well defined for particles with mass
- We define chirality instead
- as $v \rightarrow c_0$, there are only left handed fermions and right handed anti-fermions

### Pion Decay
In $\pi^\pm \rightarrow \mu^\pm + \{\nu_\mu, \bar \nu_\mu\}$
- $\pi^\pm$ has no spin, so spin must cancel out for the products1
- daughter muon is non-relativistic, so there is ample phase space for it to be in the left-handed chiral state
In $\pi^\pm \rightarrow e^\pm + \{\nu_e, \bar \nu_e\}$
- the same occurs, but electron is relativistic
