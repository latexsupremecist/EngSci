## Strong force and colour charge
- multiple quarks have the same wavefunction
- Pauli exclusion principle should prevent this
- With colour charge, the states are different
	- three quarks in baryons have different colours
	- hadrons are colourless

### Hadron Wavefunctions
$$\Psi = \Psi_{\text{space}}\Psi_{\text{spin}}\Psi_{\text{colour}}$$
- Exchanging two quarks changes the sign
	- For symmetric baryons, $\Psi_{\text{colour}}$ changes sign
- Mesons have colourless combinations from colour/anti-colour combinations
- Colours don't just fix wavefunctions, but also underpin the strong force that binds quarks together

### Quantum Chromodynamics
- Gluons bind quarks to form hadrons through colour charge
	- Explains flavour independence of strong force
	- Colour is independent of flavour
- Colour charge has higher strength (larger constant)
- EM vs Strong force
	- EM due to exchange of neutral photons
	- Strong force due to exchange of coloured gluons
		- All gluons are coloured
		- Gluons can couple to themselves

### Gluon Colour Combinations
- For an input of colour a and output of colour b, the gluon emitted is of colour $a\bar b$
	- This gives 6 combinations
	- Linear algebra provides 3 more, one of which is disallowed
	- 8 combinations in total
## Gluon Properties
### Colour confinement
If an interaction tries to remove a gluon from a hadron, energy increases, creating more gluons. Hence they cannot exist on their own.
### Asymptotic Freedom
- Strong forces get very weak at small distance
- Arises from self-screening of gluon fields
	- Self-screening: 2 quarks that are close together induces a lot of gluons
	- Destructive interference
Charmonium ($c\bar c$) and Bottomium ($b\bar b$) are experimental evidence for QCD, since their masses are determined by shape of QCD binding potential. (Charmonium should decay to a pair of D mesons, but they have greater mass. Actual strong decay to $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is suppressed by complicated gluon combination necessary to mediate interaction)
