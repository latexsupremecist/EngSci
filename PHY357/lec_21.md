## Applications of physics
- Commercialisation of electricity
- Nuclear energy
- Medical treatment and imaging
- Weapons (bad)

### Applications of particle physics
- Particle detection techniques in medical imaging

## Nuclear Fission
- Neutrons do not feel Coulomb repulsion
	- can form bound states with other nuclei
- Transuranic elements
	- Add enough neutrons until beta decay becomes favourable
	- Does not work for even-odd nucleus, split original nucleus instead, centred at A/2

### Types of Fission
- Spontaneous
	- Energetically favourable to split, see binding energy curve
- Induced
	- Due to absorption of extra neutron
	- Only for above Fe
	- Energy small per nucleon, but there are a lot of nucleons

### Qualitative Explanation
- Neutron perturbs surface
- Nucleus goes from spherical to elliptical
- Binding energy reduced such that two spherical nuclei are more stable/Coulomb repulsion splits nucleus
### Quantitative Explanation
- Let $\Delta$ be the difference in energy according to liquid drop model
- $\Delta < 0$ for $\frac{Z^2}{A} < 49$

## Nuclear Fission
- Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF) provides a quantitative basis
- Even $\approx 0$ KE neutrons can induce fission
- $^{235}U$ is more likely, since it has one unpaired neutron
	- extra neutron creates less well-bound pair
- $^{238}U$ captures extra neutron
	- changes binding energy by less than that of $^{235}U$
	- Requires extra energy to actually fission the nucleus
- Assume equal mass daughters
	- Observation: most daughters have A $\approx 95$ or $\approx 140$
	- no fundamental explanation

### Induced Fission
- First fission produces energetic neutrons
- Neutrons induce fission again
- k  is the ration of neutrons at the next stage of fission over that at the previous stage
- k < 1: subcritical, induced fission stops spontaneously
- k = 1: critical, can continue indefinitely
- k > 1: supercritical

### Controlling Fission
- Maintaining k = 1
- Control rods absorb excess neutrons, inserted or withdrawn to control k
- Exponential sensitivity to number of extra neutrons
- Over-absorb prompt neutrons, rely on delayed neutrons
	- Else position accuracy + reaction too demanding

### Engineering
- Core of reactor in cooling medium
	- extract heat for energy
	- avoid fuel rods melting

### Energy Output
- 100g can supply 2MW for a day
- 1 ton of coal supplies 0.36MW for a day
- Is radioactive waste more dangerous than CO2?
