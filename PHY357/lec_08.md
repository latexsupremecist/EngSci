## Standard Model of Particle Physics
- We study particles by either measuring differential cross sections or decays
- Regardless, there is a need to first accelerate particles

## Accelerator-based Experiments
- Fixed target
    - accelerate beam and aim at fixed target
    - rare reactions (high rate) or low energy interactions (more energy expensive)
- Collider experiments
    - two beams accelerated in opposite directions
    - less energy wasted moving centre of mass
- regardless, $E_{CM}^2 = s = (p_A + p_B)^2$

### COM energy
- Fixed target
$$p_t = (m_t, 0), p_b = (E_b, p_b)$$
$$s = (p_t + p_b)^2 = E_b^2 - |p_b|^2 + m_t^2 + 2E_bm_t = m_b^2 + m_t^2 + 2E_bm_t \approx 2E_bm_t$$
where we assume energy is much greater than mass. Then
$$s = 2Em$$
- Collider
$$s = 4E^2$$

## Luminosity
- $R = L\sigma$
- challenging for collider experiments for rare process ($\sigma << 1$)

## Accelerator
- Higher momenta imply smaller de Broglie wavelengths
- used to study nuclear structure, then nucleons, and structures inside quarks, if any
- accelerate particles, constrain trajectories, and focus to get sufficient luminosity
- Current state: 7 TeV, sensitivity as low as 10^{-20} m

### Cyclotron
- 2 vacuum chambers shaped like semicircles
- alternating voltage sources such that E field forms a spiral
- particle rotates until cyclotorn radius exceeded
- $\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{qvB}{c}$

## Linear Accelerators
- cyclotrons require non-relativistic speeds
- use drift tubes
- when particle is in a drift tube, there is a voltage gradient with the next drift tube that accelerates it to the next one
- AC required
- drift tubes get longer as particles accelerate, requires precise engineering

## Synchrotrons
- linear accelerators are expensive
- use the same RF cavities many times
- B field needs to change (special relativity)
- "late" and "early" particles arriving that stop us from getting the best kick (recall we use AC)
