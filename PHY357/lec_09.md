## How do we see "particles"
- observing their interactions with matter
    - lost energy
- classical detectors, e.g.
    - geiger counter
    - cloud chamber
    - bubble chamber
    - wire chamber
- multidisciplinary field
    - thermo
    - condensed matter
    - electronics
    - optics

## Interactions
- energy loss of heavy charged particles
- electron/positron energy loss
- photon interaction
- EM showers
- strong hadron interactions: hadron showers

## Measurement Principles
- measure energy loss, decay products (e.g. for top quarks)
- EM, strong and weak forces

## Dominant Interactions
- EM
    - with electrons: excitation, ionisation, photo-electric effect, compton scattering
    - with nucleii: elastic scattering, pair production, Bremsstrahlung
- Weak
    - negligible except for neutrinos
- Strong
    - Dominate for high energy charged and neutral hadrons

## Interaction Probability
- depends on number density and thickness of target
- rate is $r = n_1n_2\sigma/S$ where $n$ is number density and rate is unitless (number of interactions)

## Mean Free Path
- exponential
- $\lambda = \frac{1}{\sigma\rho}$, $p(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)$

## Ionisation of Heavy Charged Particles
- everything but e-/e+
- relatively low energies
- energy loss dominated by EM interactions with atomic electrons
- small cross section but huge density

## Bethe-Bloch
- see slides 10-11

## dE/dx
- has a minimum value at a certain speed (minimum ionising point)

## e-/e+ Energy Loss
- trajectory less predictable
- energy loss to radiation is more important
    - Bremsstrahlung

### Bremsstrahlung
- electron emits photon
- nucleii is needed, else
    - energy conservation implies electron has a lower speed upon emitting the photon
    - momentum is not conserved

## Critical Energy
- below which dominant energy absorption is by ionisation
