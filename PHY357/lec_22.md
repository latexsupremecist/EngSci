## Nuclear Fusion
- Binding energy increases up to Fe
- Fusing two nuclei results in more tightly bound nucleus
- Advantages over fission
	- fewer nucleon
	- more sources of fuel
	- fewer unstable/radioactive byproducts

### Overcoming the Coulomb Barrier
- Strong force
- Coulomb potential and SEMF give potential
- $$V_C \approx \frac{1}{8}A^{5/3}$$
- e.g. To fuse two 8 Be, we need $V_C \approx 4.8$ MeV
	- Not possible with simple beams, since they will scatter elastically
### Thermal Fusion Requirements
- Thermal energy requires is ~$10^{10}$K
- This is impossible, but
	- higher pressure in star cores put more nuclei in proximity
	- thermal distribution means there are some particles with kinetic energy much above the mean
	- tunnelling

### Solar Fusion
- $^1\text{H} + ^1\text{H} \rightarrow ^2\text{H} + e^+ + \nu_e + 0.4$ MeV
- $^1\text{H} + ^2\text{H} \rightarrow ^3\text{He} + \gamma + \nu_e + 5.5$ MeV
- $^3\text{He} + ^3\text{He} \rightarrow ^4\text{He} + 2^1\text{H} + 13$ MeV
- In addition, the positrons produced can annihilate with electrons and produce more energy

## CNO cycle
- carbon forming cycling
- source of all C and O found in the universe
- $3^4\text{He} \rightarrow ^{12}\text{C} + 7.3$ MeV
- It can absorb protons to form N and O

### Terrestrial Fusion
- difficulty in confinement at a high enough temperature
	- Magnetic and inertial confinement

## Biological Effects of Radiation
- 1 Gy = 1 J/kg of absorbed dose
- Effective dose: 1 Sv = 1 Gy, dimensionless weighing factor

### Radiation Therapy
- Treats cancer
- Disadvantages: damages healthy tissues more
	- multi-beam approach
	- tumour at Bragg peak

### Medical Imaging
- external or internal sources
