## Leptons

### Number Conservation
- Le = 1 for electons and electron neutrinos
- Le = -1 for their antiparticles
- Le = 0 for others
- Lmu, Ltau defined similarly
- Heavier leptons decay to lighter ones, with electrons being the lightest

### Interactions
- Only in EM and weak interactions
    - neutrinos are neutrl, so they only participate in weak interactions
- Charge, lepton number must be conserved
    - dominated by the electromagnetic interactions
    - intermediate states unknown (quantum)

### Number of leptons
- Z bosons couple to all weakly interacting particles, esp neutrinos and their antiparticles
- Assume universal weak coupling strengths to all matter
- For neutrinos with mass less than half of boson, we know there are 3

## Neutrinos
- Mass cannot be 0
- Neutrino flavours (electron, muon, tauon) are likely a mixture of mass eigenstates
    - flavour and mass eigenstates are not aligned
- eigenstates propagate with different phases, so a muon neutrino beam can develop a small mixture to electron neutrino
    - oscillation of composition of electron neutrino is $\sin^2\theta$, with wavelength $L_0 = {4E}{\Delta m^2}$

### Observations
- atmospheric oscillations create muon neutrions
- electron neutrinos created through fusion (e.g. the Sun)
- Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering

#### Atmospheric Oscillations
- cosmic rays produce twice as many muon neutrinos than electron neutrinos

#### Solar Neutrino Oscillations
- only electron neutrinos produced
- only 30% of predicted neutrinos are detected

### Neutrino Mass Hierarchy
- we don't know

### Neutrino mixing: violates conservation of lepton number?
- technically yes
- probability -48 to -50 (log) for one process
- we were just lucky lol
