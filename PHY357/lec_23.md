## Gauge Invariance
- Physics should be invariant of imaginary constructs
	- We can solve physics problems in arbitrary frames
	- Results should be the same
- Physics should be invariant of the observer (in some sense)
	- e.g. if height of observer defines gravitational potential energy
	- constant term in PE matters not

## Standard Model Higgs
- All interactions involve gauge invariant fields
	- Photon field gauge invariant: no observables that depend on absolute voltage
- Gauge invariance is natural for forces with massless force carriers
	- not the case for W/Z bosons
- Higgs proposed a workaround
	- W and Z start out massless
	- Mass is acquired by interacting with a scalar field (Higgs field)
		- by interacting with Higgs bosons
	- proposed independently by six theorists

### Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
- Mass of W/Z determined by distance from origin
- Mass difference determined by phase around brim

### Higgs Coupling to Fermions
- Higss could also interact with fermions
- Fermions could be naturally massless, acquiring mass through interactions
- In the simplest standard model, Higgs has precisely predicted couplings to all other particles
- focus of current research

### Higgs Production Mechanisms
- $H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow llll$
- $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$

### Higgs Measurements
- Measuring Higgs Coupllings
- Comparing to SM expectations
- Looking for smoking guns
