## Recap of Weak Interactions
- Charge and Parity not individually conserved
- CP conserved
- Weak force interacts with only left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles

## Pion Decay
$$\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$$
$$\pi^- \rightarrow \mu^-\bar{\nu_\mu}$$
- Pions have spin 0
- Muon and neutrino spinds must cancel out to conserve J
- Daughter muon is not relativistic, since momentum is around 1/3 of mass
- Ample phase space for muon to be in left-handed chiral state

## W and Z bosons
- Electroweak theory predicted intermediate particles in weak interactions
	- Mass of Mx = 100 GeV
- Main challenge was very small production rate
- W/Z decays to electrons and muons key to discovery

## Predictions of Electroweak Unification
- Decays to leptons a small fraction of all final states
- very distinct, can be separated from huge backgrounds
- Unification at high energies since weak interaction coupling very similar to EM

## Semi-Leptonic Decays
- Involve both quarks and leptons
	- nuclear beta decay
	- pion decay

## Universality of Weak Coupling
- Weak coupling to quarks identical to leptons
	- Same for W boson, ud, cs, $\nu$e
- Couplings to us or dc

## Quark Mixing
$$K^- \rightarrow \mu^- + \bar \nu_\mu$$
- Superposition
$$d' = d\cos\theta_c + s\sin\theta_c$$

## Cabbibo Angle
Based on observed $s + u \rightarrow W$ decays
- $\theta_c \approx 13^\circ$
- Allowed decays around $\cos^2\theta_c \approx 0.95$ leptonics W rates
- Mixing structure represented by 3x3 unitary matrix

## Estimating Weak Decays
- Given W vertices one can build a plethora of decays
- Not everything has same probability

## Neutral Current Weak Interactions
- If we do $e^+ + \mu^- \rightarrow e^+ + \mu^-$, we get a singularity
	- no black holes produced
	- neutral interactions can explain this

### Conditions on Cancellation
- quite involved
