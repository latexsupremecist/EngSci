\section{General Information}

In ECE360, we learn about semiconductor devices. We have a hardware/software co-design process.

\subsection{Course Outline}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Diodes
    \item Field-effect transistor (FET)
    \item Bipolar junction transistors (BJT)
    \item Small-signal analysis
    \item Single-stage amplifiers
    \item Operational amplifiers
    \item Introductory frequency-domain analysis
\end{itemize}

\section{Diodes}

Diodes are electronic one-way valves. They can be biased to compute any function, even an exponential. (Applications in machine learning.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Forward Biased \\
        Anode voltage greater than cathode
    \item Reverse Biased \\
        Cathode voltage greater than anode
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note: current enters from anode and exits from cathode}

We can essentially replace diodes with open and short circuits depending on the polarity.
