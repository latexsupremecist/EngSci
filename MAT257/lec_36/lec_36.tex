\section{Change of Variables Theorem}

Let $g:A \rightarrow B$ be a diffeomorphism and $f:B \rghtarrow \R$ be continuous, where $A, B$ are open subsets of $\R^n$. Then $f$ is integrable over $B$ iff $(f\circ g) |\det Dg|$ is integrable over $A$ and
$$\int_A (f\circ g) |\det Dg| = \int_B f$$

In fact, it suffices to prove one direction of the theorem, namely the $\Rightarrow$ direction.

\begin{thm}
    If the $\Rightarrow$ direction holds, so does the opposite direction.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    We are given that $g$ is a diffeomorphism; then its inverse is also a diffeomorphism. Define
    $$F(x) \equiv (f\circ g)|\det Dg|$$
    Considering $g^{-1}$, the assumption of the theorem states that
    $$\int_A F = \int_B \left(F\circ g^{-1}\right) |\det Dg^{-1}|$$
    Rewriting this in terms of $f$,
    \begin{align*}
        \int_B \left(F\circ g^{-1}\right) |\det Dg^{-1}| &= \int_B \left(f\circ g \circ g^{-1}\right) |\det Dg|\left(g^{-1}(x)\right) |\det Dg^{-1}|(x) \\
                                                         &= \int_B f(x)
    \end{align*}
    where the determinants cancel out. This can easily be proven by differentiating $g\circ g^{-1}$ and applying the chain rule.
\end{proof}
