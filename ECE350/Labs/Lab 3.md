1. Are the mobilities measured by the using Hall effect (“Hall Mobility”) the same as the drift mobilities? Why or why not? (Hint: think about what “mobility” characterizes and what affect our experimental setup may have on that)

Mobility can be thought of the "speed" of electrons and holes normalised by the electric field. Using the Hall effect, we introduce an external magnetic field to the system. This creates a Lorentz force which changes the trajectories of electrons and holes, so Hall mobilities may be different from drift mobilities.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Hall measurement methods by the van der Pauw method versus the setup described in the textbook (Sze p. 52, Fig. 8)?

The van der Pauw method has the advantage of being more general, because it applies to more irregular shapes. However, its disadvantage is that it is more complex and requires more measurements. More care has to be taken when switching the voltage probe and current sources to make sure the points of contact stay the same.
