ABSTRACT = {A multi-nanosheet field-effect transistor (mNS-FET) device was developed to maximize gate controllability while making the channel in the form of a sheet. The mNS-FET has superior gate controllability for the stacked channels; consequently, it can significantly reduce the short-channel effect (SCE); however, punch-through inevitably occurs in the bottom channel portion that is not surrounded by gates, resulting in a large leakage current. Moreover, as the size of the semiconductor device decreases to several nanometers, the influence of the parasitic resistance and parasitic capacitance increases. Therefore, it is essential to apply designâ€“technology co-optimization, which analyzes not only the characteristics from the perspective of the device but also the performance from the circuit perspective. In this study, we used Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulation to analyze the characteristics of the device and directly fabricated a model that describes the currentâ€“voltage and gate capacitance characteristics of the device by using Berkeley short-channel insulated-gate field-effect transistorâ€“common multi-gate (BSIMâ€“CMG) parameters. Through this model, we completed the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) simulation for circuit analysis and analyzed it from the viewpoint of devices and circuits. When comparing the characteristics according to the presence or absence of bottom oxide by conducting the above research method, it was confirmed that subthreshold slope (SS) and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) are improved, and power and performance in circuit characteristics are increased.},

abstract = {This article critically reviews the fabrication challenges, emerging materials (wafer, high-k oxide, gate metal, channel materials), dimensional influences, thermal effects, growth techniques utilized, performance, and reliability concerns involved in Nanosheet FET. The Nanosheet FET is getting mainstream acceptance in the semiconductor industry due to its outstanding low-power performances. The NSFET is expected to replace the state-of-art FinFET, and Nanowire FET devices in the coming years. With power and performance combined in NSFET, cognitive, edge, and other computing platforms can be delivered via hybrid cloud environments. Keeping this in view, the performance and reliability comparison of all the three devices is assessed. Several aspects such as random discrete dopants (RDD), metal grain granularity (MGG), gate-edge roughness (GER), and line-edge roughness (LER), Bias Thermal Instability (BTI), and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) influencing the performance of FinFET, NWFET, and NSFET is studied. The effect of strain engineering, surface orientation in NSFET is also studied. The primary reliability concern Self Heating effect (SHE) which is the root cause of device degradation is also assessed. Furthermore, an insight into future advanced devices (Forksheet FET, Complementary FET, Vertical Transport FET) is provided which are still under development that might possibly replace Nanosheet FET is also presented in this paper.}
