### HIS244H1: Early Modern Europe, 1648-1815

Bird course.

### JRE300: Fundamentals of Accounting and Finance

As the name suggests, accounting and finance. For most people, the lectures will be boring due to it being accounting and finance. Easy credit if you have any accounting/investing/finance exposure and understand the concept of interest. Plug and chug course.

### JRE420: People Management and Organizational Behaviour

Essentially an introductory course in Human Resources. Content is focused on understanding people's behaviour (not super complex for most ppl). Assignments and exams are almost all case studies and drawing conclusions from there. Lectures are fun-ish and if you show up to lecture and take notes + some critical thinking you can do well in this course easily. Pretty much useful if you want business certificate + HSS credit... content could be applied if you become a manager but nothing special.

### PHY356: Philosophy of Physics

It touches on important philosophers of the past while also teaching you new philosophical problems we face today in physics. This is a small class, with a light course load with group discussions and a bit of essay writing. No philosophy background required.

### TEP327: Engineering and Law

"The most chill prof you'll ever have at UofT - she even buys you pizza! The course content is also useful with real-life examples. You learn a lot about what it really means to have responsibility as an engineer - the duty to the public, accountability, and also the various details about intellectual property. I'd even go so far as to saying that a course like this should be mandatory for everyone who wants to become a real engineer.

Also, no need to "study" for this course either - all quizzes and essays in this course are taken open book, so you just need to really show up to lectures and pay attention to the general outlines. Overall a chill course just with a bit of writing, and the marking tends to be on the more generous side (course average is usually around A-)

### TEP444: Positive Psychology for Engineers

The prof wants to give out a high average (50% of the class gets an A-), you can submit assignments 6 days late and still get an A-, everything is just a reflection that takes 30 mins - 2 hrs depending on the grade you want, you go on various adventures with your group (toy store, AGO, cemetery) for each assignment, great course to meet new friends in. It is a bird course, but a fun course too.
